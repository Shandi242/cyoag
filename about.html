		<p> Vegas Nights “choose your own adventure game” seeks to give the player an opportunity to explore some of the many activities that are available if they visited the city of Las Vegas. After arriving in Vegas (home page), the player has to decide on which adventure they wish to partake in. The options at this stage are:
		<br>
			<ul>
			<li> Casino – take the chance at a gamble and win big </li>
			<br>
			<li> Tour – venture out on site seeing views </li>
			<br>
			<li> Show – enjoy nightlife excitement </li>
			</ul> 
		<br>
		<p> Upon selecting one of the three choices by clicking on the optional "click here" button, the player makes a second more defined selection based on the first choice. Depending on which adventure the player chooses, the outcome will vary.</p>
